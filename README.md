CRMint was created to make advertisers' data integration and processing easy,
even for people without software engineering background.

CRMint has simple and intuitive web UI that allows users to create, edit, run,
and schedule data pipelines consisting of data transfer and data processing
jobs.

> This README is for building and extending CRMint as a developer. For guidance

CRMint is a [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) application
written in Python for [Google App Engine Python Standard
Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/). CRMint
uses [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/) to store it's business data, and
[Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/) to store it's activity
logs.

Deploy CRMint to your [Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/),
build a data pipeline, and benefit from data integration and processing in
